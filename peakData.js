The named peak is not the highest point on the formation. This distinction belongs to either one of the pinnacles on the north ridge (don't ask me which one), or the high point on the ridge joining Lamont Peak with the the Sierra Crest, known informally as \"East Lamont Peak\". All of that notwithstanding, the Sierra Club summit register is on the named peak. It's a short, pleasant walk from Canebrake Road. On top, you are rewarded with a view of the Domelands Wilderness to the west, and the high meadows and rolling, pine-covered hills to the north and south.",

This old use trail contains only one token switchback. It can be hard to follow in places, but have faith, it is really does lead all the way to the summit area.

It will fork yet again, take the \"Long Lake Trail\", which is not on the Topo. This trail follows the east side of Long Lake and connects with the Trail that runs along the base of Elwell. When I hiked this Trail, there was a log blocking the beginning of it, apparently placed by the Forest Service. This trail is not damaged or difficult to follow; it may be difficult to follow in the winter though, so if you are doing it then, I suggest bringing a GPS because you cannot see the lake most of the time.
