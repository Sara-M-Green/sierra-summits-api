Morrison is one of the more notable mountains in the Mammoth Lakes area of the Sierra Nevada.  Its North Face is a spectacular sight when viewed from US395 near the Mammoth airport.  The rock in this area is noted for it's superb coloring in shades of white, yellow, orange, red, and brown.  Mt. Morrison's summit pendant, a lower Paleozoic roof pendant (USGS Professional Paper 1145), is composed of Dolomite and Marble - basically metamorphosed limestone.  The age is Pre-cambrian making it some of the oldest rock in the Sierra."," There are no trailheads to Mt. Morrison.  Easiest access is from Convict Lake which lies below the north side, and can be reached from US395 via the Convict Lake Rd, just south of the Mammoth airport. Convict Canyon, and the western aspects of Mt. Morrison are accessed via the Convict Creek Trail.  This trail is not in good shape, with many portions washed out in 2012.  The Mt.

As one might expect given this location, it commands superb views over the Dome Land's granite expanses, with panoramas extending beyond the surrounding wilderness to Olancha Peak to the north and towards Spanish Needle and Owens Peak to the south. In fact, the view west from the summit is used as the cover photo for the USFS Domeland Wilderness map.","The usual route up the peak climbs the class 3 East Face, a short, easy, but enjoyable scramble.

The South Face presents some short technical climbs: a 2-pitch 5.7 route named ""Immaculate Conception"" for the clean rock, and a 1-pitch class 5 trough.

It is also located just west of the Squaw Valley USA ski area, home of the 1960 Winter Olympics . There are usually two reasons for seeking the summit of Granite Chief, the peak has spectacular views in all directions and it is the target of county high pointers since it was the high point of Placer County until a new liner point was discovered in 2008 on the Placer County - Washoe County line. Granite Chief stands out as its light granite composition contrasts with the darker volcanic rock of the nearby peaks. ","The hike up is very enjoyable as it passes through some nicely wooded forests (including a University of California Ecology Study Area) as well as across open granite hillsides and through some pleasant meadows. The trail skirts along the north edge of the ski area and along a segment of the Pacific Crest Trail. This leads to the only drawback on the hike in that you almost always have the lifts of the Squaw Valley in view and are not far from civilization. The final segment of the hike passes under a ski lift and then you head for the summit from the upper lift shed. In fact if one were so inclined, a good segment of the hike can be cut off by using the gondola to Squaw’s High Camp area at 8200 ft.",https://www.summitpost.org/granite-chief/152880,https://sp-images.summitpost.org/74261.JPG?auto=format&fit=max&h=800&ixlib=php-2.1.1&q=35&s=40616eef2778ef8e98627d0a941dd8d2

From Robinson Lake, head west up the creek and aim at the lowest point between University Peak (to the North) and the unnamed peak 12,910 (to the South). A steep gully that is often filled with snow until later in the summer leads up to University Pass. Now head South and try to stay as high up on the slopes as feels comfortable in order to avoid elevation loss.
